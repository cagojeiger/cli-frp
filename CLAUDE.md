# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FRP Python Wrapper is a self-hostable tunneling solution (like ngrok) that leverages FRP's native **locations** feature for path-based routing (https://example.com/myapp/). The design emphasizes:
- **Pythonic Design**: Clean, readable classes and intuitive APIs following Python conventions
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage with tests written before implementation
- **Simple Architecture**: Clear, minimal structure focusing on core functionality
- **Native FRP Features**: Direct use of FRP's locations parameter for path-based routing

## Development Commands

### Setting up the environment
```bash
# This project uses uv for dependency management
# Install all dependencies including dev and test extras
uv sync --all-extras

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Install FRP binary (required external dependency)
# Download from: https://github.com/fatedier/frp/releases
```

### Running tests (TDD Approach)
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage (configured in pyproject.toml)
uv run pytest

# Run tests in watch mode for TDD
uv run pytest-watch

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_process.py

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run pytest -v

# Run specific test method
uv run pytest tests/test_process.py::test_process_manager_start -v

# Run tests excluding integration tests
uv run pytest -m "not integration"

# Check coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=src/frp_wrapper --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # View coverage report
```

### Linting and type checking
```bash
# Type checking with mypy (strict mode)
uv run mypy src/

# Linting with ruff
uv run ruff check src/

# Auto-formatting with ruff
uv run ruff format src/

# Run all pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Building and packaging
```bash
# Build package
uv build

# For PyPI upload (when ready)
uv run twine upload dist/*
```

## Architecture Overview

### Current Module Structure
```

tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py        # Pytest fixtures and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ test_process.py    # ProcessManager tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_client.py     # FRPClient tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_config.py     # ConfigBuilder tests
â””â”€â”€ test_*.py          # Other test modules
```

### Planned Module Structure
```
src/frp_wrapper/
â”œâ”€â”€ tunnel.py          # Tunnel management classes (HTTPTunnel, TCPTunnel)
â”œâ”€â”€ server.py          # Server management tools
â””â”€â”€ utils.py           # Helper functions
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Simple Class-Based Design**: Intuitive object-oriented API
   ```python
   # Current usage pattern
   from frp_wrapper import FRPClient

   client = FRPClient("example.com", auth_token="secret")
   client.connect()

   # Future: tunnel = client.expose_path(3000, "myapp")
   # Future: print(f"URL: {tunnel.url}")  # https://example.com/myapp/

   client.disconnect()
   ```

2. **Standard Python Exception Handling**: Clear error messages and proper exception hierarchy

3. **Context Manager Support**: Automatic resource cleanup
   ```python
   from frp_wrapper import FRPClient

   with FRPClient("example.com") as client:
       # Future: with client.tunnel(3000, "myapp") as tunnel:
       #     print(f"URL: {tunnel.url}")
       pass
   # Automatic cleanup
   ```

4. **Test-Driven Development**: All code written with comprehensive test coverage (95%+ required)

## Core Concepts

### Main Classes
- **ProcessManager** (âœ… Implemented): Manages FRP binary process lifecycle with health checks
- **FRPClient** (âœ… Implemented): Main client for connecting to FRP server
- **ConfigBuilder** (âœ… Implemented): Generates FRP TOML configuration files
- **HTTPTunnel** (ðŸš§ Planned): HTTP tunnel with path-based routing
- **TCPTunnel** (ðŸš§ Planned): Simple TCP port forwarding

### Path-Based Routing Mechanism
Uses FRP's native `locations` feature for clean URL routing:
```
User Request: https://example.com/myapp/api
    â†“
FRP Server: Route based on locations ["/myapp"]
    â†“
Local Service: Receive request on port 3000
```

FRP Configuration:
```toml
[[proxies]]
name = "myapp"
type = "http"
localPort = 3000
customDomains = ["example.com"]
locations = ["/myapp"]  # Native path routing!
```

## Development Workflow - TDD Approach

### Test-First Development
1. **Write failing test first**
2. **Write minimal code to make test pass**
3. **Refactor while keeping tests green**
4. **Repeat for each feature**

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual classes and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test FRP binary interaction (mark with `@pytest.mark.integration`)
3. **Property Tests**: Test with varied inputs using Hypothesis
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Full tunnel creation and usage

### Current Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 95% coverage enforced in pyproject.toml
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- HTML coverage reports for detailed analysis

## Important Configuration Details

### Logging (structlog)
- Structured JSON logging configured
- File output to `frp_wrapper.log`
- Configurable via environment variables

### Type Checking (mypy)
- Strict mode enabled
- All code must be fully typed
- No implicit Any types allowed
- Python 3.11+ union types (X | None) preferred over Optional[X]

### Code Style (ruff)
- Line length: 88 characters
- Target Python 3.11+
- Comprehensive rule set (E, W, F, I, B, C4, UP, ARG, PL)
- Magic numbers (65535 for ports) are acceptable

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Automatic code formatting
- Type checking
- YAML/TOML validation
- Trailing whitespace removal

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Implementation Phase (Checkpoint 2 of 8 completed)
- âœ… Project setup complete (uv, pre-commit, structlog)
- âœ… ProcessManager implemented with full test coverage
- âœ… FRPClient and ConfigBuilder implemented
- ðŸš§ Working towards Checkpoint 3 (Tunnel Management)

**Roadmap Overview** (5 weeks total):
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Basic implementation
- Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Core features
- Phase 3 (Week 5): Production ready

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Write comprehensive tests first (TDD)
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor for clarity and maintainability
4. Update documentation and examples
5. Ensure 95%+ test coverage

### Working with FRPClient
```python
from frp_wrapper import FRPClient

# Basic usage
client = FRPClient("example.com", port=7000, auth_token="secret")
if client.connect():
    print("Connected to FRP server!")
    # Do work...
    client.disconnect()

# With context manager
with FRPClient("example.com", auth_token="secret") as client:
    print("Connected!")
    # Automatic disconnect on exit
```

### Working with ConfigBuilder
```python
from frp_wrapper import ConfigBuilder

# Build FRP configuration
with ConfigBuilder() as builder:
    builder.add_server("example.com", port=7000, token="secret")
    config_path = builder.build()
    # Use config_path with ProcessManager
# Automatic cleanup of temp file
```

### Running Continuous Testing (TDD)
```bash
# In one terminal
uv run pytest-watch --clear --verbose

# In another terminal, edit code
# Tests run automatically on save
```

## Key Testing Patterns

### Unit Test Example
```python
import pytest
from frp_wrapper import FRPClient
from frp_wrapper.exceptions import ConnectionError

def test_client_requires_server():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Server address cannot be empty"):
        FRPClient("")

def test_client_context_manager(mock_process_manager):
    with FRPClient("example.com") as client:
        assert client.is_connected()
    assert not client.is_connected()
```

### Mock Patterns
```python
# Mock ProcessManager for client tests
@patch('frp_wrapper.client.ProcessManager')
def test_client_connection(mock_process_manager):
    mock_process = Mock()
    mock_process_manager.return_value = mock_process
    mock_process.start.return_value = True
    mock_process.wait_for_startup.return_value = True
    mock_process.is_running.return_value = True  # Important for is_connected()

    client = FRPClient("example.com")
    assert client.connect()
```

## Environment-Specific Notes

- Project uses Python 3.11+ features (union types, match statements)
- All dependencies managed by `uv` (not pip/poetry)
- Structured logging with structlog (JSON format)
- Comprehensive pre-commit hooks for code quality
- FRP binary must be downloaded separately (not bundled)
- Integration tests require FRP binary or use mocked processes
